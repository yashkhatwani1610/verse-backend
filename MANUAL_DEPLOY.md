## Step 2: Create Web Service Manually

1. After login, click **"New +"** button (top right)
2. Select **"Web Service"**
3. Scroll down and click **"Build and deploy from a Git repository"**
4. Click **"Connect account"** 
5. **IMPORTANT**: Choose **"Use existing repository"** or **"Public repository"**

## Step 3: The Workaround - Use a Temporary GitHub Repo

I'll help you create a simple public repo without 2FA:

### Option A: Create New GitHub Account (No 2FA)
1. Go to: https://github.com/signup
2. Use a different email
3. Create account
4. **DON'T enable 2FA**
5. Create repository: `verse-backend`
6. Make it **Public**

### Option B: Use GitLab Instead (Easier!)
1. Go to: https://gitlab.com
2. Sign up (no 2FA required)
3. Create new project: `verse-backend`
4. Make it Public

## Step 4: Push Code (I'll Help)

Once you have the repo URL, tell me and I'll give you exact commands!

## Alternative: Use Heroku (Paid but Simple)

Heroku removed free tier but it's very simple:
1. Go to: https://heroku.com
2. Sign up
3. Create app
4. Deploy via web interface
5. $7/month

## My Recommendation

**Use GitLab** - It's easier than GitHub and doesn't force 2FA!

1. Create GitLab account: https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up
2. Create new project
3. Tell me your GitLab username
4. I'll give you commands to push code
5. Connect to Render
